# vid_face_recog2

Primarily based on [webcam_face_recognition](https://github.com/indently/webcam_face_recognition) this is easy enough to use.

Add images of faces you want to recognize in the `faces` directory. Name them with the person's name. They should be rather neutral, full-faced portraits.

Then, simply run recognition.py.

You may have to allow the app to have access to your video camera.
